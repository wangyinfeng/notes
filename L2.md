# Stacking, and many to one virtualization 
istack, stack-wise

Stacking benefits:  
- The ability to operate multiple switches as a unit from a management perspective, with a
single configuration file and a single management address for access (including SNMP).
- The ability to use ports from different physical switching elements as part of a single
aggregation group.
- Single FDB, ARP table

limitations:  
- When a stack is rebooted to activate new firmware or for any other reason, the entire stack
(all of the switching elements) is rebooted at the same time. staggered upgrade
- Stacking does not support local preference. This lack of support causes some traffic to be
needlessly forwarded around the stack links to get to the port that is chosen by the
hashing metric when links are aggregated. This process is in contrast to vLAG, which
does support local preference.
    - Some vendor can support local perference
- Performance impact, when stack size more than 4 switches
- Feature support limation, support less features than standalone switch, not support L3 routing.
